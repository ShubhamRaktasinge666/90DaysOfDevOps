<h1>Core component of linux operating system</h1>
<b>Hardware</b>: It is a physical component which relies on binary language for doing operation like data storage , processing<br/>
<b>Kernel</b>: It is a very important part of linux system , because the all request which are coming from shell the kernel will process and convert into binary ( low level language ) and send to hardware . so, it can perform the operation which are given from user. After that the hardware will process that and gave kernel and it will convert in human readable language and forward the output on terminal<br/>
<b>Shell</b>: It is a command-line interpreter that translates user commands into instructions .<br>
<b>Application</b>: It is the applications are software programs that run on top of the operating system and interact with system resources through a structured hierarchy involving system libraries, the shell, and the kernel.
