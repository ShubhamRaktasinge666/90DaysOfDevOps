# Linux File System Hierarchy (the most important directories)
* ` / (root) ` - It is the top level directory in the file system hierarchy and contains all other directories and files in the system.

* ` /home ` - It is the home directory of a user. where all files and directory of a user are contains. They can use their files and directories without any permission.

* `/root` - Home directory of a super user ( root user ) separete from normal user. Use this to store files and directories that only should use by root user.

* `/etc` - It containes all configuration files realted to service , application , and system itself. also contains all users and password configuration files.

* `/var/log` - Contains log files generated by service , operating system , applications.

* `/tmp` - It contains temparory files related to applications , service . Any files stored here will be deleted after reboot.

## Additional Directories (Good to Know):
* `/bin` - contains essential command binaries (executable programs) that are required for basic system operation.
  
* `/usr/bin` - Contains the majority of user command binaries — programs and utilities that regular users and administrators run in daily work.

* `/opt` - Reserved for installing optional 3rd party software that are not part of core system distribution(ex. google chrome) I would use this directory to to see what external or commercial applications are installed.
