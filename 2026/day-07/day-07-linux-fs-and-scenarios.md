# Linux File System Hierarchy (the most important directories)
* ` / (root) ` - It is the top level directory in the file system hierarchy and contains all other directories and files in the system.

* ` /home ` - It is the home directory of a user. where all files and directory of a user are contains. They can use their files and directories without any permission.

* `/root` - Home directory of a super user ( root user ) separete from normal user. Use this to store files and directories that only should use by root user.

* `/etc` - It containes all configuration files realted to service , application , and system itself. also contains all users and password configuration files.

* `/var/log` - Contains log files generated by service , operating system , applications.

* `/tmp` - It contains temparory files related to applications , service . Any files stored here will be deleted after reboot.

## Additional Directories (Good to Know):
* `/bin` - contains essential command binaries (executable programs) that are required for basic system operation.
  
* `/usr/bin` - Contains the majority of user command binaries — programs and utilities that regular users and administrators run in daily work.

* `/opt` - Reserved for installing optional 3rd party software that are not part of core system distribution(ex. google chrome) I would use this directory to to see what external or commercial applications are installed.

#  Scenario-Based Practice 
## Scenario 1: Service Not Starting
A service called 'ssh' failed to start after a server reboot.
What commands would you run to diagnose the issue?
Write at least 4 commands in order.

Step 1 : * `systemctl status ssh`
Why : Check if the service is running or failed or stopped.

Step 2 : * `journalctl -u ssh -n 50`
Why : If service is failed check logs.

Step 3 : * `systemctl is-enabled ssh`
Why : To check if service starts automatically on boot.

## Scenario 2: High CPU Usage
Your manager reports that the application server is slow. You SSH into the server. What commands would you run to identify which process is using high CPU?

Step 1 :  `top/htop`

Why : List all the running processes. Check for processes that are CPU intensive.

Step 2 : `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10`

Why : Sort the processes by CPU percentage. Note down PID of top processes.

Step 3 : `sudo renice +10 -p PID`

Why : Increases the nice value, lowering the process priority so it gets less CPU time. Useful if you don't want to kill the process but need to reduce its impact.

Step 4 : `kill PID`

Why : Kill CPU intensive processes if necessary.

## Scenario 3: Finding Service Logs

A developer asks: "Where are the logs for the 'ssh' service?" The service is managed by systemd. What commands would you use?

Step 1 : `systemctl status ssh`

Why : Check service status first.

Step 2 : `journalctl -u ssh -n 50`

Why : Check last 50 lines of logs.

Step 3 : `journalctl -u ssh -f`

Why : Check logs real-time.

## Scenario 4: File Permissions Issue

A script at /home/user/backup.sh is not executing. When you run it: ./backup.sh You get: "Permission denied" What commands would you use to fix this?

Step 1 : `ls -l demo.sh`

Why : Check current permissions of file. Look for: -rw-r--r-- (notice no 'x' = not executable).

Step 2 : `chmod +x demo.sh`

Why : Add execute permission to file.

Step 3: `ls -l demo.sh`

Why : Verify it worked. Look for: -rwxr-xr-x (notice 'x' = executable).

Step 4: `./demo.sh`

Why : Run it.
